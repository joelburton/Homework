Subject: *URGENT* Report needed for CEO!

Hey there,

We've been trying to send the melon delivery report to the CEO, but
something is broken with the script.  The guy who started it, has 
now left to start his own startup, Squiysh ("Lyft for WinterSquash")
and you're the only developer left on the team that knows python.

The script is printing the name of the melon where the count and total
amounts should be.  I'm hoping you can help!  We need to deliver this 
report ASAP!

I've attached the code we have so far in the file produce_summary.py along
with delivery logs for the last three days.  

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead

Hey great job so far, the CEO really appreciated that report.

I think the code is a little hard to read because there's so much going on. 
Is there anything you can do to make it better?  Maybe throw in some functions?

Sincererely,
Mel
Team Lead

P.S. I've noticed that the CEO doesn't really read an email unless it's
in all UPPER CASE.  Any way you could make the script print in all uppercase
letters?
