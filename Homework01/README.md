Subject: *URGENT* Another report needed for CEO!

Hello and again, welcome aboard!

The first assignment we need you to help us with comes directly 
from the CEO himself.

He needs a report that just displays sales information for Monday. 
I don't have time to handle this myself, but I did manage to find
the attached program that might help you.  

I also went ahead and attached the latest log file, which has the 
week's sales information in it.

Thanks for your help,
Mel
Team Lead
