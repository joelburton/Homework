Subject: *URGENT* Help with Invoices!

Here's a program someone wrote to figure out if any of our customers underpaid. In the past, 
our office admin Mark would literally open the log file and scan for any new customers. If he 
found any, he would proceed to change the code so that there would be another "If statement" 
for that new customer.

There are two things to mention at this point....

1. Mark just got poached by Squysh! Which mean, now we need you to be responsible for manually 
scanning the log file for customers, and then seeing if any have underpaid for their delcious 
melons.

2. GREAT NEWS!!! Our twitter marketing campaign was a huge success

and melon solider has gotten us a massive amount of sign ups. So instead of just three 
customers, by the end of today it looks like the log file will have THOUSANDS!

Oh so, unfortunately.. yeah... we're going to need you to stay here all weekend, to update the 
code so that it checks all of our customers to make sure none have underpaid. I know it sucks, 
but unless you can think of a better way to check each of these new customers to see if they've 
underpaid, there's nothing we can do about it!!

Thanks for your help!!!
