Subject: *URGENT* Can you make this script better?

Hey,

We've been really impressed how you cleaned up some of our old
accounting scripts.  I found the attached "melon_info.py" script, 
and I was hoping you could help.

Right now, it only tracks a melon's name, if it has seeds and 
its price.  Can you help us add the ability to keep track of
the flesh color, rind color and average weight?

Also, our sales team loves to give us additional things to track at
the last minute, but i'm afraid in its current state that's going 
to be a real pain to manage. So can you think about ways that we
can make this script easier to manage, if we have to constantly change
the things we are tracking?


I'm attaching two files, "melon_info.py" is the main script and
"melons.py" contains the melon data.

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead
