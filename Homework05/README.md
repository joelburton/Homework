Subject: *URGENT* We need to get ready for the upcoming sales report meeting!

Attached you'll find the file `sales_report.csv`, which contains a line for each order placed. 
An order (and hence, each line in `sales_report.csv`) contains the salesperson's name, total amount of the order and 
total number of melons sold.

You'll also find the `sales_report.py` script, which displays a report of the total number of melons 
sold by each sales person.

Take a look at the `sales_report.py` script and figure out how it works.  You don't need to code a 
better solution right now.  But we're having a meeting with the CEO first thing very soon, so be 
prepared to talk about any inefficiencies you might find in the script (as in, what would be nice 
to have to make it better/faster?)
